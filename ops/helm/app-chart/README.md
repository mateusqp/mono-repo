# Application Helm Chart

This directory will host the Kubernetes Helm chart that deploys the backend and frontend workloads.

## Values Files

- `values.yaml`
- `values-local.yaml`
- `values-des.yaml`
- `values-hom.yaml`
- `values-prod.yaml`

Populate each file with environment-specific overrides as the project evolves.
